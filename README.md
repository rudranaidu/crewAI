# üöÄ CrewAI Framework ‚Äì Structured Learning Notes

**CrewAI** is a multi-agent orchestration framework designed to coordinate multiple AI agents working together toward a common goal. It enables complex workflows through structured collaboration between agents.

---

## üß© Core Components

- **Agents** ‚Äì Virtual team members with specific roles, goals, and tools.
- **Tasks** ‚Äì Specific jobs assigned to agents.
- **Processes** ‚Äì Defines how agents and tasks are structured and executed.

## üë§ CrewAI Agent Characteristics

Each agent in CrewAI has:
- **Role** ‚Äì Defines the function (e.g., Researcher, Coder, Reviewer).
- **Goal** ‚Äì Describes the agent's objective in the crew.
- **Tools** ‚Äì Functional capabilities (e.g., web search, calculator).
- **Backstory** ‚Äì Provides contextual background for better LLM alignment.
- **Memory** ‚Äì Maintains context across interactions.
- **Language Model** ‚Äì Powers the agent's understanding and responses.

> Agents are essentially **virtual team members** capable of autonomous decision-making within defined constraints.

## üîÑ Process Types in CrewAI

1. **Sequential Process**  
   Linear execution: Output of one agent becomes the input to the next.

2. **Hierarchical Process**  
   A **Manager Agent** oversees and delegates to subordinate agents.  
   Ideal for complex workflows requiring coordination and evaluation.

## üß† Agent Types in CrewAI

| Type                | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Task-Specific Agent | Expert in a specific task (e.g., summarization, coding).                    |
| General-Purpose     | Versatile, can adapt to a range of tasks.                                  |
| Coordinator Agent   | Acts as a project manager‚Äîallocates and monitors tasks.                    |
| Learning Agent      | Improves over time using feedback and historical data.                     |
| Reactive Agent      | Provides fast, rule-based responses.                                        |
| Deliberative Agent  | Maintains internal state and plans based on goals and environment.         |

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools vs. Tasks

- **Tools**: Capabilities agents use to accomplish tasks (e.g., browser, Python REPL).
- **Tasks**: Jobs assigned to agents (e.g., write a report, generate a summary).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation Workflow

### 1. Install Required Modules

```python
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool
